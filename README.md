# workflowbot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) for team workflow made with Probot

# Configuration file

Create a directory `.github` in the root of your repo (if it doesn't exist) and add a file named `eskworkflow.yaml`.  

## Add automatic tags for new issues on the repo

Example:

```yaml
auto_add_labels: 
  - name: "Esk tag"
    color: "aa3a4a"
  - name: "Test tagging"
    color: "123a4a"
  - name: "Tada! :tada:"
    color: "884599"
```

# WIP: Automatic workflow on a project

Creating a repository project with the name that you specified on the config file, will automatically set columns and add/move issues to the column with the specified tag.

```yaml
repo_project_workflow:
  - name: "My project"
  - columns:
    - column:
      - name: "New issues"
      - tags: "New issue"
    - column:
      - name: "To do"
      - tags: "To do"
    - column:
      - name: "In progress"
      - tags: "In progress"
    - column:
      - name: "Done"
      - tags: "Done"
```
